	\class StreamConnection
	\brief The StreamConnection is responsible for creating
	a TCP/IP stream connection with the baos server

	The StreamConnection is responsible for creating a TCP/IP socket connection
	to the remote BAOS device. It requires the IP Address of the device. The
	StreamConnection is a wrapper around the Connector which is used throughout
	the baos rpc library.

	It implements a connect and a disconnect signal. These signals are invoked
	when the stream connection is connector and disconnected respectively.
	Note: a stream connection can be auto-disconnected if the tcp/ip connection
	is terminated by the remote peer (baos device). This may occur if a connection
	timeout occurs (i.e. no socket activity for a couple of minutes).
	\sa BaosHeartbeat

	\deprecated Use ScopedBaosConnection instead.
	This class calls only the functions from BaosConnection.
