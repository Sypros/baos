/*!
	\class Connector

	A Connector can send and receive packets. This is an abstract
	interface and doesn't define a medium for the transmission
	and reception of packets.

	A Connector has a packet factory
	It is assumed that a raw rx buffer (unsigned char for example)
	is used to receive a packet from the wire and we convert the
	buffer into a packet with the packet factory.
	Packet Factory is mandatory, and if the default constructor is
	called a default packet factory is created, which will simply
	create an unknown Packet (Packet).

	A Connector has a number of packet signals (boost signals)
	The packet signals can be used to notify of rx and tx packets events
	and support multiple listeners. The signals are called from the
	NotificationHandler (see ConnectorNotificationHandler). By default
	the connector uses the AsyncConnectorNotificationHandler
	so all notifications are called from a dedicated notification thread.
	Use ConnectorNotificationHandler to invoke the notifications synchronously
	(i.e. from the thread context that they were raised in). You can also
	set a custom notification handler.

	/*!
		Opens an Connector.
		Most connectors will require one or more parameters
		to identify the remote port, such as an IP Address or
		device name. This information is managed by the property
		system. Derived connectors can provide an open with
		the requested parameters (device name etc) which should be
		saved as properties followed by a call to open(). Open
		looks to ensure that the connector isn't already open
		and calls openImpl() to handle the device specific open
		(handled by derived classes).

		The default implementation is to do nothing (in openImpl)
		and simply set the open flag to true. If a port is already open
		nothing happens, and the function simply returns.

		It invokes the openingSignal before opening the connector
		(before the call to openImpl) and after the port has been opened
		(after openImpl successfully returns) openedSignal will be invoked.
		In the event of	an error the derived class may thrown an exception,
		in which case the openedSignal will not be called.

		\note there is a special case where you can get into a deadlock when
		wrapping a connector and the event signal notification with a mutex
		You have to ensure that the destructor can be run from outside of the mutex
		for example: doing this is potentially bad:

		\code
			void my_open()
			{
				ScopedLock<FastMutex> lock(mutex_);
				Connector::Ptr port = std::make_shared<TunnelingPort>();
				port->open(ip_);

				// assign to the access port only if successfully opened
				port_ = port;
			}

			void notification_signal(int e)
			{
				ScopedLock<FastMutex> lock(mutex_);
				do_something_with_event(e);
			}
		\endcode

		The deadlock occurs in this instance int the destructor of the TunnelingPort
		when open is not successful. The destructor calls close which
		raises the Notification Event (Closing, Closed etc). However the mutex is
		already locked in my_open, and the boost signal instance can't be destructed
		until the signal handler has finished, which blocks on the mutex...

		Resolution:

		Simply ensure that Connector::Ptr port is declared outside of the mutex.
		For example:

		\code
			void my_open()
			{
				Connector::Ptr port = std::make_shared<TunnelingPort>();
				port->open(ip_);

				// assign to the access port only if successfully opened
				ScopedLock<FastMutex> lock(mutex_);
				port_ = port;
			}
		\endcode
